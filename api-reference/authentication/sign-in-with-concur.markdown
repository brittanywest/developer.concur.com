# Sign in with Concur

## Why Concur Login?

Sign in with Concur allows users to sign in to your application without creating a separate username and password. 

Concur users can simply login with their Concur credentials, leverage your application and then enjoy receiving itineraries, receipts and much more directly to their Concur account.

Our sign in process uses the secure OAuth2.0 protocol.
